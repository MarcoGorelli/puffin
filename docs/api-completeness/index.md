# API Completeness

Narwhals has two different level of support for libraries: "full" and "interchange".

Libraries for which we have full support we intend to support the whole Narwhals API,
however this is a continuous work in progress.

In the following section it is possible to check which method is implemented for which
class and backend.

!!! info

    - By design, Polars supports all the methods of the Narwhals API.
    - "pandas-like" means pandas, cuDF and Modin.
