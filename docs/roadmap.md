# Roadmap

Priorities, as of July 2024, are:

- Works towards supporting projects which have shown interest in Narwhals: scikit-learn, shiny, tubular
- Implement when/then/otherwise so that Narwhals is API-complete enough to complete all the TPC-H queries
- Add support for extra backends such as Dask
- Add extra docs and tutorials to make the project more accessible and easy to get started with
