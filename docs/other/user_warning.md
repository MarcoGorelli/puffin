# Avoiding the `UserWarning` error while using Pandas `group_by`

## Introduction

If you have ever experienced the `UserWarning: Found complex group-by expression, which can't be expressed efficiently with the pandas API. If you can, please rewrite your query such that group-by aggregations are simple (e.g. mean, std, min, max, ...)` message while using the narwhals `group_by()` method this is for you. If you haven't, this is also for you as you might experience it and you need to know how to avoid it.

The `UserWarning` is thrown for exactly the reason that is given. The pandas API most likely cannot efficiently handle the complexity of the `group_by()` operations you are trying to run. Take the following two codes as an example.

When you run:

=== "Approach 1"
    ```python exec="true" source="above" result="python" session="df_ex1"
    import narwhals as nw
    import pandas as pd
    
    data = {'a': [1,2,3,4,5], 'b': [5,4,3,2,1], 'c': [10,20,30,40,50]}

    pd_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    @nw.narwhalify
    def approach_1(df_any):

        # Pay attention to this next line
        df = (df_any
            .group_by('a')
            .agg(
                (nw.col('b')+nw.col('c')).sum().alias('d')
            )
        )

        return (df)

    print(approach_1(pd_df))
    ```

=== "Approach 2"
    ```python exec="true" source="above" result="python" session="df_ex2"
    import narwhals as nw
    import pandas as pd
    
    data = {'a': [1,2,3,4,5], 'b': [5,4,3,2,1], 'c': [10,20,30,40,50]}

    pd_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    @nw.narwhalify
    def approach_2(df_any):
        
        # Pay attention to this next line
        df = (df_any
            .with_columns(
                d=nw.col('b') + nw.col('c')
            )
            .group_by('a')
            .agg(
                nw.sum('d')
            )
        )

        return (df)

    print(approach_2(pd_df))
    ```


Both Approaches shown above return the exact same result, but Approach 1 is inefficient and returns the following error message.


```
UserWarning: Found complex group-by expression, which can't be expressed efficiently with the pandas API. If you can, please rewrite
your query such that group-by aggregations are simple (e.g. mean, std, min, max, ...).
```

You might rightly ask, what makes the first approach inefficient and the second approach efficient? To understand why Approach 2 is more efficient than Approach 1, it's essential to analyze the operations and transformations applied to the DataFrame in *line 11* of each approach. Let's break it down:

## Approach 1
```python
# From line 11

return (df
            .group_by('a')
            .agg(
                (nw.col('b')+nw.col('c')).sum().alias('d')
             )
        )
```
### Sequence of operations:

1. The Dataframe is first grouped by column 'a'.
2. The aggregation function calculates the sum of the expression `(nw.col('b') + nw.col('c'))` for each grouping and adds an alias of 'd'.

## Approach 2
```python
# Line 11 in Approach 2

return (df
            .with_columns(d=nw.col('b')+nw.col('c'))
            .group_by('a')
            .agg(
                nw.sum('d')
                )
        )
```
### Sequence of perations:

1. A new column 'd' is added to the DataFrame, where 'd' is the result of nw.col('b') + nw.col('c').
2. The DataFrame is then grouped by column 'a'.
3. The sum of the new column 'd' is calculated.

## Efficiency Analysis
**Approach 1:** This approach requires recalculating `(nw.col('b') + nw.col('c'))` for every row within each group during the aggregation process. This can be computationally expensive as the addition operation is embedded within the aggregation function. It will also result in a `UserWarning` due to inefficient query structuring, especially if the DataFrame is large.

**Approach 2:** In this approach, `(nw.col('b') + nw.col('c'))` is computed once for each row before the grouping operation. The result is stored in a new column 'd'. During the aggregation, the sum of 'd' is calculated. This avoids recalculating the addition operation multiple times within the aggregation function, making it more efficient.

### Why Approach 2 is More Efficient
1. **Reduced Redundant Calculations:** By computing the sum nw.col('b') + nw.col('c') once and storing it in a new column, Approach 2 reduces redundant calculations. This leads to a significant performance improvement, especially for large datasets.
2. **Optimized Query Execution:** Many DataFrame processing engines optimize queries better when operations are broken down into simpler steps. Adding a column first and then performing the group by and aggregation can leverage such optimizations.


## Tips for Avoiding the `UserWarning`
To ensure efficiency and avoid warnings similar to those seen in Approach 1, data scientists should follow these practices:

1. Decompose Complex Operations: Break down complex transformations into simpler steps. In this case, keep the `.agg` method simple.  Compute new columns first, then use these columns in aggregation or other operations.
2. Avoid Redundant Computations: If an operation (like addition) is used multiple times, compute it once and store the result in a new column.
3. Leverage Built-in Functions: Use built-in functions provided by the DataFrame library. In this case, using the `with_columns()` method allows you to pre-compute before grouping and aggregation.

By following these guidelines, you can are sure to avoid the error: `UserWarning: Found complex group-by expression, which can't be expressed efficiently with the pandas API. If you can, please rewrite your query such that group-by aggregations are simple (e.g. mean, std, min, max, ...)`.
